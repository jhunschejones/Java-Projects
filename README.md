# Java Projects

This repository is for projects I put together while learning Java in the spring of 2019. This is the third Object Oriented programming language I have dug into at this level, and there is a lot changing in the Java world as I am learning. If you catch any improvements in the code here, feel free to reach out. I am always happy to collaborate and learn more!

## Project Highlights:
* [DiceRoll](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Java-Projects/tree/master/DiceRoll): This was a fun opportunity to put object-oriented design to work. I wrote this app then moved some functionality out of the main method into itâ€™s own class to make the code more reusable and readable!
* [Simple Calculator](https://github.com/jhunschejones/Java-Projects/tree/master/SimpleCalculator): Another pass at using object-oriented design to create reusable code. I was also able to get more hands on experience with more data types and how they interact in Java.
