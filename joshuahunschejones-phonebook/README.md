# Phonebook

## Overview
This directory contains the code for a lightweight Dropwizard web API I built while working through the [RESTful Web Services with Dropwizard](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/restful-web-services/9781783289530/) book by Alexandros Dallas.

## Run Locally
*Required: Maven, Java JDK 1.8*
1. From the `./joshuahunschejones-phonebook` dir, run `mvn clean package`
2. To launch the executable JAR, run `java -jar target/joshuahunschejones-phonebook-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yaml`
